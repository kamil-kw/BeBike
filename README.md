# **1. Project Overview**

<a name="description"></a>

# **1.1. Project Description**

One of the best benefits of living in the Netherlands is having access to over 37 000 km of bicycle paths, the only thing you need to enjoy is a bike. Therefore I have created a bike shop website, where viewers can buy a bike, as well as some basic parts and accessories.

The website allows users to use a search engine to find the most suitable product and with just one click add to the shopping trolley. The website is intuitive with a simple design, so with this e-commerce website buying a bike is as simple as ordering food delivery and who doesn’t like good home delivery.

# **1.2 Project Requirements**


PUT HERE WHAT WAS EXPECTED FROM THE PROJECT

    * [**1.2.1 Main Technologies**](#maintech)

    * [**1.2.2 Mandatory Requirements**](#mandatory)






<a name="ux"></a>

# **2. UX**

Be Bike website is designed in modern coloristic with white background. The coloristic gamma used was #EF476F #118AB2 #073B4C

Use can either choose from the dropdown menu the product category and scroll through the range of products or can use the search engine to find a specific item. 

To make a purchase users can pay with a credit card as the checkout page features stripe pay-ments.

User can also be engaged by reviewing the products. 

(#projectGoals)

# **2.1.1 Project Goals**

My goal was to create a simple and intuitive store, where customers can purchase bikes and bike related items. Website has a simple design, allowing user to navigate easily through it, by doing that customers can focus on the content, rather than trying to find items on the page.

# **2.1.3 User Expectations** (#userExpectations)

The website should have a simple user interface, with the navigation to each section clear
-	The menu is intuitive and clear to read.

-	The user can navigate easily through an interface. 

-	The website responsiveness is achieved on all devices. 

-	The user has a clear overview of all products/product groups. 

-	Before making a payment the total purchase price is displayed, and product quantities can be removed/ adjusted. 

-	Website has a secure payment method, giving the user comfort feeling


# **2.1.4 Trends of Modern Websites** (#trends)

Based on the new trends in the website design, I have used the concept from the 1980s – Memphis design, which in this case was making the main page design simultaneously more color, approachable and adventurous.  


# **2.2. Structure** (#structure)

Responsiveness design has been included in this project, as users are using different devices (including mobiles, laptops/ PC, and tablets). This is to ensure user achieves the best experiences on their chosen device.

-	User can easily navigate through labeled buttons 

-	All elements are consistent in font size, and color scheme.

# **7. Search Engine Optimalisation**](#development)
To improve the search engine optimisation (SEO) of the site I:

- Added keywords in a meta tag to my base.html. The keywords were researched using [WordTracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/), there are a number of short-tail and long-tail keywords for teritory of Netherlands.

- This is a list of all the keywords I came up with,
    - short tail words - bike, bicicle, ebike,city bike
    - long tail words - bike shop near me, electric bike, mountain bike, transport bike

- I ended up using these:

Word Bike

  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |


I chose these keywords because they didn't have incredibly high volume and competition.

# **8. Marketing**](#marketing)

For my marketing strategies, I decided to go with content marketing, Social media and email marketing root. As these are free options and very effective for an E-commerce store.

- Social media - Using these platforms will help build and interact with customers to build relationships and loyalty. This also helps build the brand. Followers will help share the business posts and in result gain more traction with other people. The same content can be across all social media platforms.

- Email marketing - Using email marking via a newsletter will be beneficial as it is a free source of marketing. Those who are subscribed are more likely to convert into paying customers. This will increase sales and returning customers as I can provide discount codes and other special offers. A good pro is that the business has total control over the design of the emails.
