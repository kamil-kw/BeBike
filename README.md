# **1. Project Overview**

<a name="description"></a>

# **1.1. Project Description**

One of the best benefits of living in Netherlands is to have access to over 37 000 km of bicycle paths, the only thing you need it to enjoy is a bike. Therefore I have created a bike shop website, where viewer can buy bike, as well as some basic parts and accessories. 
The website allows user to use search engine to find the most suitable product and by just one click add to the shopping trolley. The website is intuitive with simple design, so with this e-commerce website buying a bike is as simple as ordering a food delivery and who doesn’t like a good home delivery.

# **2. UX**

Be Bike website is designed in modern coloristic with white background. The coloristic gamma used was XXX
User can either choose from dropdown menu the product category and scroll through the range of products, or can use the search engine to find specific item. 
To make a purchase user can pay with a credit card as checkout page features stripe payments.
User can also be engaged by reviewing the products.

•	As a first-time visitor, I want to easily view the total of my purchases at any time so that I can avoid spending too much.
•	As a first-time visitor, I want to sort the list of available products so that I can easily identify the best rated, best priced and categorically sorted products.
•	As a first-time visitor, I want to sort a specific category of products so that I can find the best-priced or best-rated products in a specific category, or sort the products in that category by name.
•	As a first-time visitor, I want to easily add items to my basket so that I can view all the products I would like to purchase before completing payment.

# **2.1.3 User Expectations** (#userExpectations)

The website should have a simple user interface, with the navigation to each section clear and con-cise.

•	The website is responsive on all devices.
•	To be able to see a clear selection of products.

# **2.1.4 Trends of Modern Websites** (#trends)

Based on the new trends in the website design, I have used the concept from 1980s – Memphis design, which in this case was making the main page design simultaneously more colour, approach-able and adventurous. 


# **2.2. Structure** (#structure)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.
•	Responsive on all device sizes
•	Easy navigation through labelled buttons
•	Footer at the bottom of the each page that links to the social media websites, newsletter subscription form and business pages.
•	All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.
